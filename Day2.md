-# Network Security

### FW (Firewall)
Controls traffic between networks, allowing or blocking data based on security rules.  
**Example:** A firewall can block unauthorized access attempts from IP addresses outside the organization's trusted network.

### IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
- **IDS**: Detects and alerts on suspicious activity.
- **IPS**: Blocks threats in real-time.  
**Example:** An IPS might block repeated login attempts from an unusual location, preventing brute-force attacks.

# Application Security

Protects applications by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in code and configurations. This includes secure coding practices and patch management.  
**Example:** A company implements input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks on its login page.

# Endpoint Security

### EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
Monitors endpoints (like laptops and servers) for abnormal activity, providing detailed alerts for quick response.  
**Example:** EDR software detects and isolates a compromised laptop showing signs of malware activity.

### AV (Antivirus)
Detects and removes known malware threats such as viruses, trojans, and ransomware.  
**Example:** Antivirus software identifies and removes a trojan horse embedded in a downloaded email attachment.

# Email Security

### Phishing Mail
Uses tools to detect and block phishing emails that attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information.  
**Example:** An email security filter flags an email impersonating the CEO and asking employees to wire money to a fraudulent account.

### Email Gateway
Filters emails to prevent spam, malware, and other harmful content from entering or leaving the organization.  
**Example:** An email gateway blocks incoming emails containing malicious links or attachments to prevent malware infection.

# Web Protection

### WAF (Web Application Firewall)
Filters and blocks malicious HTTP/S traffic, protecting web applications from common attacks.  
**Example:** A WAF prevents an SQL injection attack on the company's e-commerce website, keeping customer data safe.
