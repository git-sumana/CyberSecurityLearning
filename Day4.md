# OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

The **OSI model** is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different networking protocols interact in a computer network. It divides the network communication process into **seven distinct layers**, each responsible for specific tasks.

## OSI Layers Overview

| **Layer** | **Name**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | **Physical Layer**         | Responsible for the physical connection between devices. Deals with hardware transmission (e.g., cables, switches, electrical signals).       |
| 2         | **Data Link Layer**        | Provides error detection/correction and frame synchronization. Ensures reliable data transfer between devices on the same network.           |
| 3         | **Network Layer**          | Responsible for routing data across different networks. Defines logical addressing (IP addresses). Manages packet forwarding and routing.   |
| 4         | **Transport Layer**        | Ensures reliable data transfer between devices by managing flow control, error correction, and retransmission (e.g., TCP, UDP protocols).     |
| 5         | **Session Layer**          | Manages sessions or connections between applications. Controls dialog and data exchange between applications on different devices.           |
| 6         | **Presentation Layer**     | Translates data into a format that can be understood by the application layer. Responsible for data encryption, compression, and conversion. |
| 7         | **Application Layer**      | The layer closest to the end user. Interacts directly with software applications. Handles protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.                |

## Key Points

- The OSI model is a **reference model** for understanding how data communication should occur in a network.
- It helps in troubleshooting network issues by isolating problems to specific layers.
- While the OSI model is theoretical, it provides a clear understanding of network functions.
- The **TCP/IP model** is another widely used model for networking, which is more practical and less granular than the OSI model.
