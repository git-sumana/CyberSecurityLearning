| **Tactic**            | **Description**                                                                                       | **Examples of Techniques**                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Access**     | Techniques used to gain initial foothold in a network/system.                                        | Phishing, Exploit Public-Facing Application, Drive-by Compromise |
| **Execution**          | Techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a system.                             | Command and Scripting Interpreter, Scheduled Task, Exploitation for Client Execution |
| **Persistence**        | Techniques to maintain access after the initial compromise.                                          | Account Manipulation, Create or Modify System Process, Boot or Logon Autostart Execution |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system.                                             | Process Injection, Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism |
| **Defense Evasion**    | Techniques to avoid detection or hinder defense mechanisms.                                          | Obfuscated Files or Information, Impair Defenses, Masquerading |
| **Credential Access**  | Techniques used to steal credentials like usernames and passwords.                                   | Credential Dumping, Input Capture (Keylogging), Brute Force |
| **Discovery**          | Techniques used to gain knowledge about the environment and systems.                                 | System Information Discovery, Network Service Discovery, File and Directory Discovery |
| **Lateral Movement**   | Techniques to move across systems and maintain access to network resources.                          | Remote Services, Pass the Hash, Taint Shared Content |
| **Collection**         | Techniques to gather data of interest from the victim's system.                                      | Clipboard Data, Screen Capture, Archive Collected Data |
| **Command and Control** | Techniques to communicate with compromised systems for further operations.                           | Application Layer Protocol, Web Protocols, Encrypted Channel |
| **Exfiltration**       | Techniques to steal data from a network to an external system.                                       | Exfiltration Over Web Service, Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol |
| **Impact**             | Techniques used to disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data.                        | Data Destruction, Resource Hijacking, Service Stop |
