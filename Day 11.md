## 1. CIA Triad
The **CIA Triad** represents the foundational principles of cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurate and untampered.
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are available when needed.

**Example**: Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances confidentiality. MFA prevents unauthorized access by requiring multiple verification factors.

## 2. AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
- **Authentication**: Verifying a user's identity.
- **Authorization**: Granting permissions to access resources.
- **Accounting**: Tracking user activities for auditing.

**Example**: A VPN login requiring a username/password (authentication), checking access rights (authorization), and logging session details (accounting). This ensures secure access and monitoring.

---

## 3. Authentication vs Authorization
- **Authentication**: Confirms who the user is.
- **Authorization**: Determines what resources a user can access.

**Example**: Logging into Gmail (authentication) vs being allowed to send emails (authorization). This distinction ensures access is granted appropriately.

## 4. Adware
Adware is software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material when a user is online.

**Example**: A browser toolbar that shows ads while browsing. Adware generates revenue by displaying targeted advertisements.

---

## 5. Spyware
Spyware secretly collects user information without consent.

**Example**: **CoolWebSearch** hijacks browser searches to track user data. It gathers sensitive details like browsing habits or credentials.

---

## 6. Ransomware
Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.

**Example**: **WannaCry** spread globally, exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows. Victims had to pay to regain access to their files.

---

## 7. Trojan
A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate software but performs malicious actions.

**Example**: **Emotet**, initially a banking Trojan, evolved to distribute ransomware. Trojans are deceptive, tricking users into installing them.

---

## 8. Worms
Worms self-replicate and spread across networks, often without user action.

**Example**: **Stuxnet**, designed to target Iranâ€™s nuclear centrifuges. Worms can disrupt systems and spread rapidly.

---

## 9. Virus
A virus attaches itself to files or programs and executes malicious code when triggered.

**Example**: The **ILOVEYOU** virus spread via email attachments, causing widespread damage. Viruses require user action to propagate.

---

## 10. Rootkits
Rootkits hide malicious activities and provide attackers with administrative privileges.

**Example**: **Zanilco** rootkit was designed to bypass antivirus tools. Rootkits conceal threats and persist undetected.

---

## 11. Keyloggers
Keyloggers record every keystroke typed by the user to steal sensitive data.

**Example**: A malicious USB device installing a keylogger to capture login credentials. Keyloggers are often used for stealing passwords.

---

## 12. Cryptography
### a. Symmetric Cryptography
Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.

**Example**: **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for encrypting sensitive data. It is efficient for securing large datasets.

### b. Asymmetric Cryptography
Uses a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption.

**Example**: **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** for secure data exchange. ECC ensures secure communication over public channels.

---

## 13. Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
DSS is used for creating digital signatures to ensure data authenticity and integrity.

**Example**: Signing a document with **RSA** digital signatures. Digital signatures verify the sender's identity and the message's integrity.

---

## 14. Hashing
Hashing converts data into a fixed-size value using a mathematical algorithm, ensuring integrity.

**Examples**: 
- **SHA-256**: Used in blockchain for transaction validation. It ensures data integrity in decentralized systems.
- **SHA-1**: Deprecated due to vulnerabilities. Weaknesses in SHA-1 make it insecure for modern applications.

---

## 15. Encryption Algorithms
Encryption algorithms convert plaintext into ciphertext to protect data.

**Examples**:
- **Symmetric**: AES, DES. AES is widely used for encrypting sensitive information.
- **Asymmetric**: RSA, ECC. RSA is commonly used for securing online transactions.
