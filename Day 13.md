# SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

SIEM is a comprehensive security solution that combines **Security Information Management (SIM)** and **Security Event Management (SEM)** to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by hardware and applications. It helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats.

## Types of Logs Used in SIEM

Logs are essential for monitoring and identifying potential security threats. Some of the common types of logs used in SIEM include:

### 1. **Firewall Logs**
   - Logs traffic flow across network boundaries.
   - Includes details of allowed and blocked connections.

### 2. **System Logs**
   - Tracks events within operating systems (e.g., login/logout attempts, system errors).

### 3. **Application Logs**
   - Logs generated by specific software applications to track errors, transactions, and user activities.

### 4. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System Logs (IDS/IPS)**
   - Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.

### 5. **Authentication Logs**
   - Tracks login attempts, password changes, and access authorizations.

### 6. **DNS Logs**
   - Tracks DNS queries, helping to detect domain abuse and malicious activities.

### 7. **Endpoint Logs**
   - Logs from endpoints like desktops, laptops, and mobile devices for tracking user activity.

### 8. **Web Server Logs**
   - Tracks HTTP requests, access patterns, and potential attacks like SQL injections or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Threat Intelligence Websites

Threat intelligence (TI) tools are used to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Here are some popular websites/tools:

### 1. **AbuseIPDB**
   - A platform for checking IP addresses reported for malicious activities.
   - Website: [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com)

### 2. **VirusTotal**
   - Analyzes files, URLs, domains, and IPs to detect malware and other threats.
   - Website: [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)

### 3. **BrowZerling**
   - A cross-browser testing tool that helps identify potential vulnerabilities in website configurations.
   - Website: [BrowZerling](https://www.browserling.com)

### 4. **IPVoid**
   - A tool for checking if an IP address is listed on any public blacklists.
   - Website: [IPVoid](https://www.ipvoid.com)

### 5. **IP Blacklist Check**
   - Tools that scan IPs against various blacklists to identify suspicious activity.

## Importance of Logs and Threat Intelligence
1. **Early Detection**: Identifying suspicious activities early to mitigate risks.
2. **Incident Response**: Providing detailed evidence for post-incident analysis.
3. **Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements.
4. **Proactive Security**: Leveraging logs and TI to prevent future attacks.
