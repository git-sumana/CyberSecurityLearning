### 1. What is an IP?
   - **IP** stands for **Internet Protocol**. It is a set of rules that define how data is formatted and transmitted over networks, like the internet or local networks.
   - An **IP address** is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, enabling devices to locate and communicate with each other.
   - There are two main versions of IP addresses:
     - **IPv4**: Uses a 32-bit address format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
     - **IPv6**: Uses a 128-bit address format (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`), which allows for a much larger address pool to accommodate more devices.

### 2. What is a MAC Address?
   - **MAC** stands for **Media Access Control** address. It is a unique identifier assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.
   - A MAC address is often represented in hexadecimal format, such as `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
   - Unlike IP addresses, which can change based on the network, a MAC address is hardcoded into the device and does not change.
   - MAC addresses help in identifying devices within a local network and are crucial in network security and management.

### 3. What are Clients and Servers?
   - In network architecture:
     - A **Client** is a device or software that requests services or resources from a server. For example, when you use a web browser to access a website, your browser acts as a client.
     - A **Server** is a device or software that provides services, data, or resources to clients over the network. Examples include web servers, file servers, and email servers.
   - This client-server model allows devices to communicate and share resources across networks, including the internet.

### 4. What is a Topology and Its Types?
   - **Topology** refers to the arrangement or layout of different elements (like devices and connections) in a computer network.
   - Network topologies determine how data flows between devices and influence the network’s performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
   - Common types of topologies include:
     - **Bus Topology**: All devices are connected to a single central cable, or "bus."
     - **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
     - **Ring Topology**: Devices are connected in a circular format, with each device having exactly two neighbors.
     - **Mesh Topology**: Every device is connected to every other device, providing high fault tolerance.
     - **Hybrid Topology**: A combination of two or more different types of topologies to meet specific needs.
